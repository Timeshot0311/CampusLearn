## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of CampusLearn up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- An active [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd campus-learn
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

The application requires Firebase credentials to connect to the backend.

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project.
2.  Navigate to your Firebase project, go to **Project Settings**, and under the "General" tab, find your "SDK setup and configuration".
3.  Copy the values from the `firebaseConfig` object into your `.env` file like so:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123...:web:...
```

### 3. Running the Application

Once your environment variables are set, you can start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

## üß™ Testing

The CampusLearn platform includes a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure reliability and code quality.

### Unit & Integration Tests

Jest is used for unit and integration testing of our backend services. These tests verify the internal logic of functions that interact with the database.

```bash
# Run all unit tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### End-to-End (E2E) UI Tests

Cypress is used for E2E testing, which simulates real user flows in a browser.

1.  **Set up Test Credentials:**
    -   Open the `cypress.env.json` file.
    -   Update the `CYPRESS_TEST_USER_EMAIL` and `CYPRESS_TEST_USER_PASSWORD` with the credentials of a test user in your Firebase project (e.g., the `student@campus.com` user).

2.  **Run the Tests:**
    -   To open the interactive Cypress Test Runner and watch tests execute live in a Chrome browser, run:
        ```bash
        npm run test:e2e:open
        ```
    -   To run all tests headlessly in the terminal (ideal for CI/CD), run:
        ```bash
        npm run test:e2e
        ```

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is configured for seamless, zero-downtime deployment using **Firebase App Hosting**. The deployment strategy is based on a Git-based workflow. Pushing code to the main branch will automatically trigger a build and deploy the new version to the live environment. For more details, see the `apphosting.yaml` file.
